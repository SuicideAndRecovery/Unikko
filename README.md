# Unikko - A userscript to hide reactions in the Sanctioned Suicide news feed

## Description

Unikko adds a button to hide reactions in the News Feed on the Sanctioned Suicide forums. It is a
  userscript: a bit of code that runs in a web browser and changes a
  website.

Unikko has been tested only in one version of Chromium and one version
  of Firefox. It may have many issues.

You can discuss issues in the
  [forum thread](https://sanctioned-suicide.org/threads/unikko-a-prototype-userscript-to-hide-reactions-in-the-news-feed.28759/).

## Limitations

* Not tested well. May have many issues, especially on browsers other
  than Mozilla Firefox.
* May break easily as changes are made to the forum.
* May or may not contribute to battery life drain on mobile devices if
  left to run on the News Feed page for too long.

## Install

1. Install a userscript browser extension:
  * For Chrome or Chromium: Add
  [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
  or a similar extension to Chrome.
  * For Firefox: Add
  [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
  or a similar extension to Firefox.
2. Click or tap the [raw userscript URL](https://github.com/SuicideAndRecovery/Unikko/raw/master/unikko.user.js).
3. A window should appear. Press the button to Install the userscript.
